## 🐦 Current Build: Tweet Generator Agent

An AI-powered tweet generation tool built using Google Colab, `ipywidgets`, and the Gemini (Google Generative AI) API.  
It takes user inputs like topic, tone, audience, and hashtags — and generates a customized tweet under 280 characters.

## 💡 Vision

To explore how generative AI can assist analysts by building tools that:
- Simplify communication
- Generate automated insights
- Enhance decision-making workflows

This project is the first step in that journey. More tools and AI integrations coming soon.
